1. Create the following directory structure-:
   /home/prateek/linux
   ├── centos
   │   ├── commands.txt
   │   ├── security.txt
   │   └── updates
   │       └── latest
   └── ubuntu
       └── apt.txt
Sol. 
mkdir -p ~/linux/centos
mkdir linux/ubuntu
cd linux/centos
touch commands.txt
touch security.txt
mkdir updates
touch updates/latest
cd ../ubuntu
touch apt.txt


2. Considering the above directory structure, copy the file called security.txt to the updates directory.
   Remove the file called security.txt from the directory called updates.
   Copy the directory called updates from centos to ubuntu.
   Remove the directory called updates from ubuntu directory.
   Using only one command copy the file called apt.txt and the directory called updates to linux directory.
   Remove the file called apt.txt and the directory called updates from the linux directory interactively (by prompting the user).
   Rename the directory called centos to redhat.
   Copy the file called security.txt to ubuntu directory as sec.txt
   
Sol. 
cp linux/centos/security.txt linux/centos/updates/security.txt
rm linux/centos/updates/security.txt
cp -r linux/centos/updates linux/ubuntu
rm -r linux/ubuntu/updates
cp -r linux/centos/updates linux/ubuntu/apt.txt linux
rm -ri linux/updates linux/apt.txt
mv  linux/centos linux/redhat
cp linux/redhat/security.txt linux/ubuntu/sec.txt


3. Create a file named users.txt by redirecting the output of the who command.
   Remove the file in a secure manner by overwriting the file 50 times before removing.
Sol. 
who > users.txt
shred -vun 50 users.txt


4. Remove the entire directory structure without prompting.
Sol.
rm -rf ~/linux
