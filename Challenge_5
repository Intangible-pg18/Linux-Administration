sudo useradd Eddie
sudo passwd Eddie
su Eddie


2. Create a new user using the useradd specifying the following: the home directory (which will be created as well), the Bash shell and a comment. 
   Create a new group using the groupadd command and then add the user to the newly created group.
   Check the groups to which the user belongs.
Sol.
sudo groupadd grp
sudo useradd -m -c "New User" -s /bin/bash -G grp U1
sudo passwd U1
